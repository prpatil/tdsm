\title{Regression-based feature selection}
\usage{
reg_fs(pairmat, outcome, covar = NULL, npair = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{pairmat}{An m x n matrix of pairwise features with rows=features, columns=samples
(generated by empirical control feature selection)}

\item{outcome}{A vector of outcomes of length n}

\item{covar}{An optional n x p matrix of additional covariates to adjust for}

\item{npair}{The number of paris we wish to select}
}
\value{
pairs A vector with the index for each chosen pair
}
\description{
Leverages the fact that the F-statistic for y~x and
x~y is the same to quickly choose pairs that add conditional
value for predicting an outcome. Also runs a separate pair-on-pair
regression to eliminate collinear pairs.
}
\details{
This function takes the output from empirical_controls.R and reduces it
to a set of pairs of size "npairs" that are predictive of the outcome of interest.
The paris are chosen conditionally so that the next pair chosen adds predictive
ability additional to the pairs that have already been chosen. At each step,
we consider a regression of
