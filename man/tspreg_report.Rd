\title{Generate a knitr report for model-building using tspreg}
\usage{
tspreg_report(path = NULL, train, outcome, covar = NULL, val = NULL,
  val_outcome = NULL, val_covar = NULL, title = "Example", seed = 47209)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to an alternative report (via dup_report + edits). Default NULL runs the standard report.}

\item{train}{A matrix of continuous data with features in rows
and samples in columns}

\item{outcome}{A binary outcome vector with length = ncol(data)}

\item{covar}{(optional) A data frame of additional covariates to adjust for with samples in rows and covariates in columns}

\item{val}{(optional) A validation dataset, where feature rownames are contained in the feature rownames of the training data}

\item{val_outcome}{(optional) Outcome vector for validation data. Required if val is provided.}

\item{val_covar}{(optional) A data frame matrix of additional covariates. Required if covar and val are provided.}

\item{title}{A character string setting the rport title. Default "Example".}

\item{seed}{A random seed set at the beginning of the report. Default 47209}

\item{filepath}{A character string specifying the name of the file. Default NULL, which generates a file called "[curtime]_output.html" in the working directory.}
}
\value{
The final decision tree model fit in the procedure.

\description{
Generate a knitr report for model-building using tspreg
}
\details{
This is a wrapper to the TSP model-building procedure. Minimal
input is a matrix of continous data from which to build features (i.e. a
gene expression matrix) and a binary outcome vector. This function will
supply the provided information to an R markdown template that runs
a standardized model-building procedure. The output will appear in the
working directory as an HTML report.

If the user as created their own version of the standard report with custom
edits, they may supply the full path to this file in the "path" variable. The
function will use the alternative markdown file to build the report instead.
